## Hi, I'm Jake! 

I'm an Assistant Professor at UC Berkeley. My lab is located in the [Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry and Vision Science](https://vision.berkeley.edu/), the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/), and the [Helen Will Neuroscience Institute](https://hwni.berkeley.edu/). I'm broadly interested in how brains and artificial intelligence makes sense of the world. This is my personal website. The Yates lab website can be found [here](https://yates-lab.github.io/).
