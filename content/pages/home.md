### Perceptual Decision Making

Over two decades of research on perceptual decisions have resulted in a simple circuit model where oculomotor areas integrate signals from motion selective areas to form decisions about the direction of motion. I am interested in how sensory signals in area MT are read out by higher brain areas.

To investigate this, I have collected a dataset of simultaneously recorded neurons in MT and parietal area LIP while a monkey performs a decision about the direction of motion. I use computational models to understand the statistical dependence of the choice on signals in each area and the dependence between areas. In collaboration with Leor Katz, I use reversible inactivation to interrogate this circuit with causal manipulations.

### Sensory Encoding Of Motion
In a collaboration with Johannes Burge and Kenneth Mitchell, I am using normative models of speed selectivity based on natural scene statistics to interpret the role of external and internal noise in the response of speed-tuned neurons in area MT.
