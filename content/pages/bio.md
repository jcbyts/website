title: Hi, I'm Jacob Yates

I'm an [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/) Fellow of the [Life Sciences Research Foundation](http://www.lsrf.org/). I'm currently a postdoc in the Department of Biology at the University of Maryland under the supervision of Dr. [Daniel Butts](http://www.neurotheory.umd.edu/people/dbutts). I collaborate closely with Drs. [Jude Mitchell](http://marmolab.bcs.rochester.edu/index.html) and [Michele Rucci](http://aplab.bcs.rochester.edu/) at the University of Rochester.

My research is broadly focused on how mammalian brains extract information about the world using vision. This is an active process and is highly specialized in humans and other primates. My specific research questions are related to general principles of active vision and primate-specific specializations for high-resolution spatial vision.

You can find my full publication list [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UJm-TkYAAAAJ&hl=en) and I am sometimes active on Twitter [@jcbyts](https://twitter.com/jcbyts).

This website is an overview of my work, but it is (very much) under construction.
