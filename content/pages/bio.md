title: Hi, I'm Jacob Yates

I’m a post-doctoral fellow at the [Center For Visual Science](https://www.cvs.rochester.edu/) at the University of Rochester in the labs of [Jude Mitchell](http://marmolab.bcs.rochester.edu/index.html) and [Greg Deangelis](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/people/faculty/deangelis_greg/index.html). I did my PhD work at the University of Texas, co-advised by [Jonathan Pillow](http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/) and [Alex Huk](http://motion.cps.utexas.edu/).

I’m interested in how sensory signals are encoded into neural activity and how that activity is decoded to form perceptions and actions. To approach this, I use a combination of electrophysiology, psychophysics and computational modeling.
